A flow is a group action of ℝ on a measurable space Ω, satisfying:
1. Measurability of the joint action
2. Identity element acts as the identity map
3. Group composition property

In QFT, flows represent spacetime translations of field configurations.

Each time-slice of the flow is measurable. We need this applying
Fubini's theorem and for establishing measurability of time averages.

This follows from the joint measurability of the flow and the fact that
the constant function t and the identity function are measurable.

Time-average (Cesàro) along the flow over window length `R`.
This represents the average value of a function f along the orbit of ω
for time parameter ranging from 0 to R.

In ergodic theory, this average converges (as R→∞) to the space average
for almost all starting points ω.

For R = 0, we define the average to be 0 by convention.

Helper lemma for measurable_timeAverage: Proves measurability of parametric integrals involving flows.
This lemma establishes that for a measurable function f and a flow φ,
the function ω ↦ ∫ f(φ.T s ω) ds over [0,R] is measurable.

This is a critical step in proving that time averages are measurable functions.
The key insight is to recognize that (s,ω) ↦ f(φ.T s ω) is jointly measurable
when f is measurable and φ is a flow, which allows us to apply our general
parametric integration result.

A flow is ergodic if every invariant set has either measure zero or full measure.

  Key insight: In an ergodic system, every invariant set has either measure zero
  or full measure. This implies invariant functions must be constant.

  Proof approach:
  1. Assume f is invariant but not essentially constant
  2. Show there must exist a level set A = {x | f(x) ≤ a} with measure strictly
     between 0 and μ(univ)
  3. Show this level set is invariant
  4. This contradicts ergodicity

  -- Since f is not essentially constant, there must exist some threshold 'a'
  -- where the level set {x | f(x) ≤ a} has measure strictly between 0 and μ(Set.univ)
  -- We use our helper lemma for this
  have h_exists_split := non_const_has_intermediate_level_set f hf_meas h_not_const

  -- Get the threshold where the measure splits
  rcases h_exists_split with ⟨a, ha_pos, ha_lt_univ⟩

  -- Define the level set A := {x | f x ≤ a}
  let A := {x | f x ≤ a}

  -- Step 1: Show A is measurable using our helper lemma

  Since we've reached a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false.
  Therefore, f must be essentially constant.

A clean OS4 : invariant measure, ergodicity by sets, and time-average equals ensemble-average a.e.

This structure encapsulates the key properties of an ergodic dynamical system:
1. A probability measure on the state space
2. A flow (group action) on the state space
3. The measure is preserved by the flow
4. The flow is ergodic (only trivial invariant sets)
5. Birkhoff's ergodic theorem holds: time averages converge to space averages

In the context of QFT, this  ensures that spacetime translations act ergodically
on the field configurations, which is crucial for reconstructing vacuum correlations.

QFT-flavored packaging of the OS4, using a probability measure on field space.

This presents the same mathematical content as OS4 but with notation more
familiar to quantum field theorists, using dμ for the probability measure and
A for observables (measurable functions on field space).

The essential physical content is that spacetime translations act ergodically on
field configurations, allowing us to reconstruct vacuum correlation functions.
